//  Practical Math
// The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
// Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
// At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
// At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
// At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
// You have a fuel budget of $175.
// The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.

//  PT 1: How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
// Best idea is for me to give a range of low end to high end amount of fuel needed.
